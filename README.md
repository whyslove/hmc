## About
This repository is used to build an ecosystem analogue to Notion/Todoist.
Features, technologies and methods used it this project may NOT be the best choice in production. Nonetheless, features, technologies and methods from this project is something that I want to learn and to test by myself. 

The name of this repo is derived from fantasy film "Howl's Moving Castle" due to it's hodgepodge nature.
